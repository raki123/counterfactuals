* write a help description for the solver
* add setup information (requirements.txt etc.)
* add a license
* add a readme
* add unittests
* make it a pip package


maybe:
* enable multi-query inference by keeping stdin open and reading from there
* check if the multi-query idea for the top down version is a good idea in the bottom up case
